# UCSD Data Science Course Websites

This site contains snapshots of course websites for many of the courses in UCSD's Data Science curriculum. Forks made of sites from the time I took them, or most recent if those were unavailable.

This mirror is created for personal use, as a reference for past course lectures I found to explain topics better than google. To be used as a quick refresher on choice topics, persisted in case course contents are modified/updated.
